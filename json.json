An incredibly important part of the design process was coming up with ways so some characters could share assets, but still look unique from each other.\n\nThe work done as a concept artist varies. In some concepts I would visually explore scenarios the main kitty character would find themselves in, such as how they would jump into a trash bin, interact with adults and children, handling in-game missions, and weird places the cat could nap (very important).\n\nI also provided storyboards for cutscenes, conceptual environment sketches, background art and animations, designed the logo, and several dozen hats (also very important).",
